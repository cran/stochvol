Changes in Version 0.8-4:
  - Fixed a bug introduced in version 0.8-2, where I forgot to let
    .svsample know about the changes in update(...). Thanks to Keiran
    Thompson for pointing this out.
  - References updated.

Changes in Version 0.8-3:
  - Minor changes in vignette.

Changes in Version 0.8-2
  - update(...) now takes an additional boolean argument preventing
    an update of mu (but instead hold mu = 0 fixed). This feature is
    needed e.g. for factor stochastic volatility models.
  - C++ function "update" rewritten to use ordinary pointers instead of
    Rcpp objects. This became necessary because Rcpp objects cannot be
    constructed re-using memory due to the SEXPREC structure. See
    https://www.mail-archive.com/rcpp-devel@lists.r-forge.r-project.org/msg06811.html and follow-ups for a more detailed expanation.

Changes in Version 0.8-1
  - Added a -I directive for compiler in Makevars.win so that winbuilder
    finds headers in inst/include/.
  - Re-ran all code used in vignette.

Changes in Version 0.8-0
  - Re-structured main sampler code in sampler.cpp: new function "update"
    performs a single MCMC iteration. Additionally, this function is also
    made available to be called by C/C++ code in another package. To use
    this function within C/C++ code, simply #include <update.h> (defined
    in inst/include) in the C/C++ code of your package, which itself
    Imports:/Depends: stochvol (>= 0.8). See package factorstochvol for
    an example using this mechanism.
  - Minor stylistic changes in helper functions and subroutines at
    C++-level).
  - Fixed a minor bug in sampler.cpp where regressionNoncentered
    returned sigma instead of fabs(sigma) when phi is drawn outside of
    the unit sphere.
  - Fixed DESCRIPTION to Import: Rcpp (instead of Depend:).
  - Fixed NAMESPACE: Now has "importFrom(Rcpp, evalCpp)" as required by
    Rcpp 0.11.0.

Changes in Version 0.7-2
  - Updated CITATION file
  - Updated vignette (mainly stylistic changes)

Changes in Version 0.7-1
  - Manual is now provided as a vignette.

Changes in Version 0.7-0
  - Added a manual.
  - Changed the default prior for mu from c(-10, 3) to c(0, 100) to
    avoid disaster when percentage log-returns (instead of log-returns)
    are used but the prior is not adapted accordingly.
  - Included the date in the exrates dataset.
  - Changed svsample to also accept vectors with zero-returns; it throws
    a warning now (instead of an error) and adds an offset constant.
  - Fixed plot.svdraws to reset par to old values.
  - Added a "residual plot" feature. Thanks to Hedibert Lopes for
    pointing this out.
  - Added the convenience function "logret" for taking log-returns of a
    given series, with the possibility of de-meaning.
  - Cleaned up summary.svdraws, which now returns a "summary.svdraws"
    object. For actual printing, print.summary.svdraws is used.
  - Cleaned up summary.svsim, which now returns a "summary.svsim" object.
    For actual printing, print.summary.svsim is used.

Changes in Version 0.6-1
  - Fixed typo in wrapper.R which previously disallowed changing the
    "expert" argument "proposalvar4sigmaphi": Replaced
    "proposalvar2sigmaphi" by "proposalvar4sigmaphi" on line 76.
  - Included EUR exchange rates from the European Bank's Statistical Data
    Warehouse. Use with "data(exrates)".
  - Added CITATION file.
  - Replaced Rprintf by REprintf and cat(...) by cat(..., file=stderr())
    for status reports. Thanks to Kurt Hornik for pointing this out.

Changes in Version 0.6-0
  - Introduced ".svsample" for minimal overhead sampling. Intended to
    be used as a plug-in into other MCMC samplers. No input checking, use
    with proper care!
  - Disabled progress bar in non-Unix-like systems due to problems with
    console flushing.
  - Some bug fixes for solaris. Seems to build fine now. Thanks to Brian
    Ripley for reporting the bugs.

Changes in Version 0.5-1
  - Replaced all paste0(...) calls by paste(..., sep='') for
    compatibility reasons.

Changes in Version 0.5-0
  - First CRAN release version.

TODO: 
  - code updatesummary in C (apply w/ quantiles is slow)
  - Make AWOL sampler available for fixed parameters. Thanks to Hedibert
    Lopes for pointing this out.
