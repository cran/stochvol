TODO: Clean up summary.svdraws to make use of print.summary.svdraws

Changes in Version 0.6-1
  - Fixed typo in wrapper.R which previously disallowed changing the
    "expert" argument "proposalvar4sigmaphi": Replaced
    "proposalvar2sigmaphi" by "proposalvar4sigmaphi" on line 76.
  - Included EUR exchange rates from the European Bank's Statistical Data
    Warehouse. Use with "data(exrates)".
  - Added CITATION file.
  - Replaced Rprintf by REprintf and cat(...) by cat(..., file=stderr())
    for status reports. Thanks to Kurt Hornik for pointing this out.

Changes in Version 0.6-0
  - Introduced ".svsample" for minimal overhead sampling. Intended to
    be used as a plug-in into other MCMC samplers. No input checking, use
    with proper care!
  - Disabled progress bar in non-Unix-like systems due to problems with
    console flushing.
  - Some bug fixes for solaris. Seems to build fine now. Thanks to Brian
    Ripley for reporting the bugs.

Changes in Version 0.5-1
  - Replaced all paste0(...) calls by paste(..., sep='') for
    compatibility reasons.

Changes in Version 0.5-0
  - First CRAN release version.
